DIGITALIZATION PROPOSALS

I. Use of Augmented Reality (AR) in Maintenance

Augmented Reality (AR) is an innovative technology finding increasing applications in various industrial sectors, including maintenance. In the context of SBGS, the use of AR in maintenance aims to revolutionize how technicians interact with equipment and machinery. This technology combines the real world with virtual elements, creating an interactive and immersive experience.

Concept and Benefits: Enhanced Training, Faster and More Accurate Maintenance, Downtime Reduction, Predictive Maintenance, Improved Documentation
  
Operation of the AR Maintenance Application

The AR maintenance application at SBGS follows a multi-step process to facilitate machine detection, procedure selection, real-time information and procedure visualization, and data backup for future analysis.

Machine Detection: The AR application activates automatically on the maintenance site, using the smartphone or tablet camera to scan the environment and detect machines through specific visual markers (QR codes) or pre-installed RFID tags.

Procedure Selection: Once machines are detected, the application allows the technician to select the specific machine and browse a list of available maintenance procedures.

Visualization of Information and Procedures: After selecting the procedure, the AR application displays relevant information in real-time. This may include detailed 3D schematics of the machine, specific components to inspect, lubrication points, repair instructions, and more.

Data Backup: Throughout the maintenance process, the AR application automatically records each action taken by the technician. This documentation is saved in a secure database for later analysis and processing. This data includes photos or videos of the machine, technician notes, and maintenance-related information.

Limitations of Mobile AR Applications for Maintenance

While mobile applications for Augmented Reality (AR) have undoubtedly opened new possibilities in maintenance, they come with their set of limitations that can impact the technician's experience and raise data security concerns.

Disadvantage of Holding a Phone: One of the main challenges is that mobile AR applications often require technicians to hold their smartphones or tablets to access augmented information. This constant need to hold and interact with a device can be uncomfortable, especially during complex tasks that require the use of both hands. Additionally, dependence on mobile devices exposes them to potential damage, disrupting workflow and leading to costly replacements.

Data Security and Privacy: Another major concern involves data security and privacy. Personal smartphones, including those used by technicians for work-related tasks via AR applications, can be vulnerable to various cybersecurity threats. This vulnerability could expose sensitive company information to potential risks, including malware or spyware compromising critical maintenance data and, in some cases, providing unauthorized access to business operations. Ensuring the security of company data becomes essential in such scenarios.

Expanding into the World of Smart Glasses: A Glimpse into the Future
As we examine the limitations of mobile AR applications for maintenance, it's time to turn our gaze toward the future and explore a promising alternative: smart glasses. Smart glasses represent a natural evolution of Augmented Reality (AR) for maintenance technicians, offering significant advantages that could address many challenges faced by current mobile AR applications.

Hands-Free Interface: One of the most obvious advantages of smart glasses is that they provide a hands-free interface. Technicians no longer need to hold a smartphone or tablet to access AR information. Instead, data is directly projected in front of their eyes, allowing convenient and effortless access to instructions, schematics, and other essential information while keeping their hands free for maintenance tasks. This can significantly improve technician efficiency and safety.

Data Protection and Privacy: Smart glasses dedicated to work also offer advantages in terms of data security. Unlike personal smartphones, these devices can be tightly controlled by the company, significantly reducing the risks of data leaks or security compromises. AR applications deployed on these glasses can be secured and monitored centrally, ensuring the protection of sensitive information.

Seamless Integration: Smart glasses can seamlessly integrate into existing maintenance processes. The collected data can be synchronized with maintenance management systems, ensuring complete traceability of maintenance activities. Additionally, these devices can be updated remotely to include new features and improvements, ensuring they stay up-to-date with the ever-evolving needs of the business.
